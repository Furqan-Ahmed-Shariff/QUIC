This repository contains an implementation of the **QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections)** protocol. QUIC is a transport layer network protocol designed by Google that improves upon traditional protocols like TCP with faster connection establishment, improved security, and better performance for modern internet applications.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **High Performance:** Faster connection establishment using 0-RTT (Zero Round Trip Time).
- **UDP-Based Protocol:** Built on top of UDP for reduced latency.
- **Multiplexing:** Simultaneous streams without head-of-line blocking.
- **Enhanced Security:** Built-in encryption comparable to TLS/SSL.
- **Resilience to Network Changes:** Improved performance in mobile environments with frequent handovers.

## ðŸ“„ Protocol Highlights

1. **Reduced Latency:**
   - Unlike TCP, QUIC reduces handshake time, enabling near-instant communication.
2. **Encryption by Default:**
   - Encrypted communication from the outset, ensuring data integrity and privacy.
3. **Multiplexed Streams:**
   - Streams are independent, preventing issues like head-of-line blocking in HTTP/2.
4. **Connection Migration:**
   - Maintains connection during network transitions (e.g., switching between Wi-Fi and cellular).
